### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cristiane S. Damo. 

âœ¨I'm a Analysis and Systems Development student. 

I have a degree in humanities and I have experience in historical archives but now I decided to change career.

ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently learning about Object Oriented Programming, Python, Django, Git and GitHub.
